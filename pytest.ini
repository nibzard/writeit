# Legacy pytest.ini - Configuration moved to pyproject.toml
# This file is kept for backward compatibility but all configuration
# is now centralized in pyproject.toml under [tool.pytest.ini_options]
#
# To see current pytest configuration:
# pytest --collect-only --quiet
#
# Key features configured in pyproject.toml:
# - Automatic async test detection with asyncio_mode = "auto"
# - Comprehensive test markers for different test types
# - Timeout protection for long-running LLM operations
# - Coverage configuration optimized for async code
# - Enhanced error reporting and test discovery
