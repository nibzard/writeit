## ADR-001: Domain-Driven Design Architecture

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Authors**: WriteIt Team

## Context

WriteIt started as a monolithic application with unclear domain boundaries. As the application grew, we faced challenges with:
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficulty in testing individual components
- Unclear responsibilities and business logic placement
- Scalability limitations

## Decision

We adopted Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to restructure WriteIt around clear business domains:

1. **Bounded Contexts**: Defined 5 clear domain boundaries:
   - Pipeline Domain: Pipeline templates, execution, step management
   - Workspace Domain: Multi-tenant workspace isolation and configuration
   - Content Domain: Template management, style primers, content generation
   - Execution Domain: LLM integration, caching, token tracking
   - Storage Domain: Persistence, LMDB operations, data access

2. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Implemented ports and adapters pattern to:
   - Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns
   - Enable easy testing with mock dependencies
   - Support multiple infrastructure implementations

3. **CQRS Pattern**: Separated read and write operations to:
   - Optimize query performance
   - Simplify command handling
   - Enable different storage strategies for reads vs writes

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns across domains
- Improved testability with well-defined interfaces
- Better scalability with domain isolation
- Easier maintenance and feature addition
- Reduced coupling between components

**Trade-offs:**
- Increased initial complexity
- More boilerplate code for interfaces
- Steeper learning curve for new developers
- Potential performance overhead from abstraction layers

## ADR-002: Event Sourcing for Pipeline State Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Authors**: WriteIt Team

## Context

Traditional state management approaches (CRUD operations) presented several challenges:
- Difficulty tracking pipeline execution history
- Complex state restoration after failures
- Limited audit capabilities
- Challenges with debugging and troubleshooting

## Decision

Implemented event sourcing for pipeline state management:

1. **Event Store**: All state changes captured as immutable events
2. **State Reconstruction**: Current state derived from event stream
3. **Snapshots**: Periodic state snapshots for performance optimization
4. **Event Types**: Comprehensive event coverage for all state transitions

Event types include:
- Pipeline lifecycle: created, started, completed, failed, cancelled
- Step execution: started, completed, failed, retried
- User interactions: response selected, feedback provided
- System events: state snapshots, errors

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail of all pipeline executions
- Easy state restoration after failures
- Time travel debugging capabilities
- Support for branching and alternative execution paths
- Better performance through snapshot optimization

**Trade-offs:**
- Increased storage requirements
- More complex state management logic
- Potential performance impact for large event streams
- Learning curve for event-driven patterns

## ADR-003: Two-Tier LLM Response Caching

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-15

**Authors**: WriteIt Team

## Context

LLM API calls are expensive and slow. Without caching:
- High operational costs from repeated API calls
- Poor user experience with slow response times
- Limited scalability due to API rate limits
- Inconsistent responses for identical prompts

## Decision

Implemented a two-tier caching strategy:

1. **Memory Cache (Tier 1)**:
   - Fast in-memory cache for frequently accessed responses
   - LRU eviction policy with 1000 entry limit
   - Sub-millisecond access times
   - Volatile (lost on restart)

2. **Persistent Cache (Tier 2)**:
   - LMDB-based persistent storage
   - Survives application restarts
   - Workspace-isolated namespaces
   - 24-hour TTL with configurable expiration

**Cache Key Generation**:
- SHA256 hash of: prompt + model + context + workspace
- Ensures cache isolation and correctness
- Handles context-dependent scenarios

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- 60-80% reduction in LLM API costs
- Sub-millisecond response times for cache hits
- Improved user experience and scalability
- Consistent responses for identical inputs
- Workspace isolation for security

**Trade-offs:**
- Increased memory usage for cache storage
- Cache key generation overhead
- Potential for stale responses
- Complex cache invalidation logic

## ADR-004: Hexagonal Architecture with Dependency Injection

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-23

**Authors**: WriteIt Team

## Context

Traditional layered architecture created tight coupling between business logic and infrastructure, making testing difficult and limiting flexibility. We needed a way to:
- Test business logic independently of infrastructure
- Support multiple infrastructure implementations
- Reduce coupling between components
- Improve maintainability and extensibility

## Decision

Adopted Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) with dependency injection:

1. **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic with no infrastructure dependencies
2. **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (storage, LLM, web, CLI)
4. **Dependency Injection Container**: Manages component lifecycle and dependencies

**Key Patterns**:
- **Ports**: Interfaces defined by application layer
- **Adapters**: Infrastructure implementations of ports
- **Dependency Injection**: Automatic dependency resolution
- **Service Registration**: Configuration-based component registration

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- Excellent testability with mock dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy infrastructure replacement
- Reduced coupling between components
- Better maintainability

**Trade-offs:**
- Increased complexity with more interfaces
- Learning curve for dependency injection
- Performance overhead from DI container
- More boilerplate code
