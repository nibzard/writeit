# Feature Specification: WriteIt - LLM Article Pipeline TUI Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-me-writeit`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build me "writeit" app based on the following specifications. # LLM Article Pipeline - Functional Specification for WriteIt TUI app ## üéØ Core Vision A **minimalist, composable article generation pipeline** that transforms raw inputs into polished articles through interactive, stepwise LLM processing. Solves LLM weaknesses (hallucination, sycophancy) through human-in-the-loop feedback and multi-pass refinement. **Key Principle**: Each step is a checkpoint where humans can course-correct before proceeding."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: LLM article pipeline with human-in-the-loop feedback system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: Writers (actors), Pipeline processing (actions), Articles & feedback (data), Multi-step workflow (constraints)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Authentication/user management not specified
   ‚Üí Content export formats need clarification
   ‚Üí Style primer management unclear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Create article through 4-step pipeline with human feedback
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (Pipeline, Article, Step, etc.)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items remain for user input
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A content writer wants to transform raw source material into a polished article through an interactive pipeline that generates multiple angles, creates outlines, writes drafts, and performs final polish. At each step, they can review multiple AI-generated options, provide feedback, and choose the best direction before proceeding to the next step.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new article project with source material and target audience, **When** the writer initiates the pipeline, **Then** the system generates multiple article angles and presents them for selection
2. **Given** a selected article angle, **When** the writer proceeds to outline step, **Then** the system creates a detailed outline and allows feedback for the draft phase
3. **Given** a completed outline with user feedback, **When** the system generates the draft, **Then** multiple AI models provide draft versions for user comparison and selection
4. **Given** a selected draft, **When** the writer requests polish, **Then** the system refines the content for clarity, flow, and style consistency
5. **Given** a completed article at any step, **When** the writer wants to make changes, **Then** they can rewind to previous steps without losing work
6. **Given** multiple pipeline runs, **When** the writer wants to reference past work, **Then** all completed articles and intermediate steps are saved and retrievable

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no AI models are available or fail to respond?
- How does system handle incomplete user feedback or empty responses?
- What occurs when a user wants to abandon a pipeline mid-process?
- How does the system manage storage limits for saved pipelines and artifacts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a text-based user interface that works in terminal environments
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute articles through a 4-step pipeline: angles ‚Üí outline ‚Üí draft ‚Üí polish
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to provide source material and target audience as initial inputs
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate multiple response options at each pipeline step using different AI models
- **FR-005**: System MUST display AI-generated responses to users in real-time as they are generated
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to select preferred responses and provide feedback for subsequent steps
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to rewind to previous steps and create alternative branches from any point
- **FR-008**: System MUST save all pipeline runs with complete artifact history for later reference
- **FR-009**: System MUST apply consistent writing style guidelines throughout the entire pipeline process
- **FR-010**: System MUST export completed articles in readable format with full metadata
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to merge parts from multiple AI responses with optional AI assistance
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation and control
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle pipeline interruption and resumption gracefully
- **FR-014**: System MUST authenticate with multiple AI model providers [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific providers and authentication methods?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST store user preferences and writing style configurations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: local storage vs. cloud storage requirements?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle concurrent pipeline executions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single user multiple pipelines or multi-user support?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Pipeline Configuration**: Defines the multi-step process with model selections, prompt templates, and default parameters for specific content types
- **Pipeline Run**: A specific execution instance containing all artifacts, user selections, and metadata from start to completion
- **Step Artifact**: Individual AI model responses at each pipeline stage, including prompts used, raw outputs, and user selections
- **Article**: The final output containing polished content along with complete generation history and metadata
- **Style Primer**: Reusable writing guidelines and voice definitions that ensure consistency across pipeline steps
- **User Session**: Manages active pipeline state, user preferences, and interaction history during application use
