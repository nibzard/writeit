# WriteIt Refactoring Plan - Domain-Driven Design & Quality Focus

**Goal**: Transform WriteIt into a robust, maintainable, and extensible codebase using Domain-Driven Design principles. Breaking changes are acceptable - prioritize quality over backward compatibility.

**Architecture Philosophy**: 
- Domain-driven design with clear bounded contexts
- Hexagonal architecture (ports & adapters)
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns
- Event-driven communication between domains
- Dependency injection and inversion of control

## Phase 1: Foundation & Domain Modeling (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Define Domain Boundaries & Bounded Contexts

- [✅] **Define Core Domains** - COMPLETED 2025-01-15 16:45
  - [✅] `Pipeline Domain`: Pipeline templates, execution, step management
    - **Current Implementation**: `models/pipeline.py`, `pipeline/executor.py`, `pipeline/events.py`
    - **Responsibilities**: Pipeline configuration, step definitions, execution orchestration, state management
    - **Key Entities**: Pipeline, PipelineRun, PipelineStep, StepExecution, PipelineTemplate
    - **Domain Events**: Pipeline started/completed/failed, step completed
    - **Boundaries**: Owns pipeline lifecycle from template to execution results

    - **Domain Events**: Workspace created/activated/deleted, config updated
    - **Boundaries**: Owns workspace lifecycle and multi-tenancy concerns
  
  - [✅] `Content Domain`: Template management, style primers, content generation
    - **Current Implementation**: `validation/` (pipeline/style/template validators), `docs/` (content generation)
    - **Responsibilities**: Template validation, style primer management, content generation artifacts
    - **Key Entities**: ContentTemplate, StylePrimer, GeneratedContent, ValidationResult
    - **Domain Events**: Template created/validated, content generated
    - **Boundaries**: Owns all content creation, validation, and template management
  
  - [✅] `Execution Domain`: LLM integration, caching, token tracking
    - **Current Implementation**: `llm/cache.py`, `llm/token_usage.py`
    - **Responsibilities**: LLM provider abstraction, response caching, token usage analytics, execution context

- Pipeline Domain → Storage Domain: For persisting run state and results
- Workspace Domain → Storage Domain: For workspace-isolated data access
- Execution Domain → Storage Domain: For caching LLM responses
- Content Domain → Storage Domain: For template and artifact persistence
- All Domains communicate through Domain Events (event-driven architecture)

**Cross-Cutting Concerns**:
- Error handling spans all domains with domain-specific error types
- Logging and monitoring are handled by infrastructure adapters
- Security and validation are enforced at domain boundaries

- [✅] **Create Domain Directory Structure** - COMPLETED 2025-01-15 17:15

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] **Type Safety**: All code must pass mypy strict mode
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% code coverage
- [ ] **Documentation**: All public APIs documented
- [ ] **Performance**: No regression in execution time
- [ ] **Security**: All inputs validated, no pickle usage

### Domain-Driven Design Principles

- [ ] **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across code and docs
- [ ] **Bounded Contexts**: Clear domain boundaries with minimal coupling
- [ ] **Domain Models**: Rich domain models with behavior, not anemic data structures
- [ ] **Aggregate Roots**: Clear aggregate boundaries with consistent state
- [ ] **Domain Events**: Decouple domains through events

### Architecture Principles

- [ ] **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- [ ] **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use
- [ ] **Command Query Separation**: Separate read and write operations

---

## Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] **Zero mypy errors** in strict mode
- [ ] **95%+ test coverage** across all domains
- [ ] **Zero security vulnerabilities** from static analysis
- [ ] **Sub-100ms** average API response time
- [ ] **Zero memory leaks** in long-running processes

### Maintainability Metrics
- [ ] **Cyclomatic complexity** < 10 for all methods
- [ ] **Class coupling** < 5 dependencies per class
- [ ] **Documentation coverage** 100% for public APIs
- [ ] **Code duplication** < 3% across codebase

### Functionality Metrics
- [ ] **All existing features** working as before
- [ ] **New features** easily addable following patterns
- [ ] **Performance** maintained or improved
- [ ] **User experience** unchanged or enhanced

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [ ] **Incremental refactoring** to avoid big-bang failures
- [ ] **Feature flags** for new implementations
- [ ] **Rollback procedures** for each phase
- [ ] **Performance monitoring** throughout refactoring

### Team Risks
- [ ] **Documentation** of each refactoring step
- [ ] **Code reviews** for architectural decisions
- [ ] **Knowledge sharing** sessions
- [ ] **Pair programming** for complex refactoring

This refactoring plan transforms WriteIt into a robust, maintainable system following domain-driven design principles while maintaining quality and extensibility as primary goals.
