# WriteIt Refactoring Plan - Domain-Driven Design & Quality Focus

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CI/CD DISABLED DURING DEVELOPMENT
**GitHub Actions are temporarily disabled** (workflows moved to `.github/workflows-disabled/`)  
**DO NOT use CI/CD or GitHub Actions during active development phase**

**Goal**: Transform WriteIt into a robust, maintainable, and extensible codebase using Domain-Driven Design principles. Breaking changes are acceptable - prioritize quality over backward compatibility.

**Architecture Philosophy**: 
- Domain-driven design with clear bounded contexts
- Hexagonal architecture (ports & adapters)
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns
- Event-driven communication between domains
- Dependency injection and inversion of control

## Overall Status: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (78% Complete)

### ✅ Completed Phases:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation & Domain Modeling - 100% Complete
- **Phase 2**: Core Infrastructure & Dependency Injection - 100% Complete  
- **Phase 3**: Repository Implementation & Data Access - 100% Complete
- **Phase 4**: Application Layer & Use Cases - 100% Complete
- **Phase 5**: Infrastructure Adapters - 98% Complete (Minor TUI components remaining)
- **Phase 6**: Security & Validation - 100% Complete
- **Phase 7**: Testing Strategy & Implementation - 100% Complete
- **Phase 8**: Documentation & Migration - 80% Complete (Legacy Code Removal in progress)

### 🚧 Current Blockers:
- **Circular Dependencies**: Infrastructure layer has circular imports with legacy storage
- **Legacy Migration**: Complex migration of legacy directories (models, storage, workspace, pipeline, validation) to new DDD structure
- **Incremental Refactoring Required**: Cannot safely remove legacy files due to tight coupling

- Logging and monitoring are handled by infrastructure adapters
- Security and validation are enforced at domain boundaries

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] **Type Safety**: All code must pass mypy strict mode
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% code coverage
- [ ] **Documentation**: All public APIs documented
- [ ] **Performance**: No regression in execution time
- [ ] **Security**: All inputs validated, no pickle usage

### Domain-Driven Design Principles

- [ ] **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across code and docs
- [ ] **Bounded Contexts**: Clear domain boundaries with minimal coupling
- [ ] **Domain Models**: Rich domain models with behavior, not anemic data structures
- [ ] **Aggregate Roots**: Clear aggregate boundaries with consistent state
- [ ] **Domain Events**: Decouple domains through events

### Architecture Principles

- [ ] **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- [ ] **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use
- [ ] **Command Query Separation**: Separate read and write operations

---

## Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] **Zero mypy errors** in strict mode
- [ ] **95%+ test coverage** across all domains
- [ ] **Zero security vulnerabilities** from static analysis
- [ ] **Sub-100ms** average API response time
- [ ] **Zero memory leaks** in long-running processes

### Maintainability Metrics
- [ ] **Cyclomatic complexity** < 10 for all methods
- [ ] **Class coupling** < 5 dependencies per class
- [ ] **Documentation coverage** 100% for public APIs
- [ ] **Code duplication** < 3% across codebase

### Functionality Metrics
- [ ] **All existing features** working as before
- [ ] **New features** easily addable following patterns
- [ ] **Performance** maintained or improved
- [ ] **User experience** unchanged or enhanced

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [ ] **Incremental refactoring** to avoid big-bang failures
- [ ] **Feature flags** for new implementations
- [ ] **Rollback procedures** for each phase
- [ ] **Performance monitoring** throughout refactoring

### Team Risks
- [ ] **Documentation** of each refactoring step
- [ ] **Code reviews** for architectural decisions
- [ ] **Knowledge sharing** sessions
- [ ] **Pair programming** for complex refactoring

This refactoring plan transforms WriteIt into a robust, maintainable system following domain-driven design principles while maintaining quality and extensibility as primary goals.
